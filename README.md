A demo of Firebase using a restaurant recommendation app.

This project is inspired by this [codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firestore-web) on using cloud firestore.

To run, install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Add a firebase credentials (private key) file named `firebase_credentials.json` : https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments

Then `python3 app.py`
